### Phase 1 — Full UI Redesign ✅ COMPLETE (merged to main 2026-04-01)

**All 24 tasks shipped and merged.** The frontend has been fully rebuilt.

**What was delivered:**
- CSS design token system: `frontend/src/index.css` — CSS custom properties for all colors, shadows, radius; full light + dark mode via `.dark` class + `data-theme` attr
- Tailwind config simplified to semantic CSS var tokens (`frontend/tailwind.config.js`)
- Framer Motion installed + motion constants (`frontend/src/constants/motion.js`): `spring`, `stagger`, `pageTransition`, `scaleIn`, `fade`
- ThemeContext updated — persists to localStorage, syncs `.dark` class and `data-theme`, exposes `theme`/`toggleTheme` (`frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx`)
- **12 new base UI components** in `frontend/src/components/ui/`:
  - `Button` — 4 variants (primary/secondary/ghost/destructive), 3 sizes, loading state
  - `Card` — hover-lift with spring animation
  - `Badge` — 8 variants including admin/editor/viewer role badges
  - `Input` + `Textarea` — focus glow, label association via `useId`, error state
  - `Modal` — AnimatePresence, Escape key, backdrop blur, bottom-sheet on mobile
  - `Spinner` + `Skeleton` — shimmer loading states
  - `Avatar` + `AvatarGroup` — initials fallback, deterministic color, stacked group
  - `Tooltip` — 4 positions, hover-controlled
  - `ProgressRing` — animated SVG with `useMotionValue`/`useTransform`, glow filter
  - `ThemeToggle` — spring rotate animation on icon swap
- **App.jsx** — `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` page transitions, `/profile → /settings` redirect (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)
- **RootLayout + Navbar** — sticky blur nav, `layoutId` sliding active indicator, ThemeToggle, Avatar linked to settings (`frontend/src/layouts/RootLayout.jsx`)
- **Landing page** — 3D parallax card stack (mouse-move CSS vars), hero stagger, features `whileInView`, orb background (`frontend/src/pages/Home/Home.jsx`)
- **Auth page** — split layout (dark left panel with orb + dot pattern, light right panel), Google OAuth only (`frontend/src/pages/Auth/Auth.jsx`)
- **Auth Callback** — swapped old LoadingSpinner for `ui/Spinner` (`frontend/src/pages/Auth/Callback.jsx`)
- **Dashboard** — 4 stat cards with `ProgressRing`, stagger grid, project cards with inline progress, skeleton loading, empty state (`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`)
- **New Project Chat** — 2-panel layout (input left, roadmap output right), drag-drop file upload zone, generation skeletons, preserved all existing hooks (`frontend/src/pages/NewProjectChat/NewProjectChatPage.jsx`)
- **Project Detail** — 3-panel layout: left sidebar phase nav (with `layoutId` indicator + ProgressRing), main content with `PhaseSection` accordion, fixed bottom progress bar, mobile scrollable phase tabs, MCP placeholder in sidebar (`frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetail/ProjectDetailPage.jsx`)
- **Settings** — consolidated single-scroll page: Profile section, 3 role cards (Developer/Founder/Student) with animated selection, API key section with usage bar (`frontend/src/pages/Settings/SettingsPage.jsx`)
- **Accept Invitation** — animated 3-state card (loading/success/error) with SVG path-draw checkmark, orb background (`frontend/src/pages/AcceptInvitation/AcceptInvitationPage.jsx`)
- **Profile** — simplified to `<Navigate to="/settings" replace />` (`frontend/src/pages/Profile/Profile.jsx`)

**UI polish completed (2026-04-01 session):**
- Committed all pre-Phase-1 unstaged collaboration work (backend services, TeamPanel, projectService, SQL fix files)
- Fixed double `pageTransition` animation: removed redundant `motion.div` wrapper from `RootLayout` — each page handles its own transition
- Fixed `group-hover` arrow animation on Dashboard project cards (added `group` class to `Card`)
- Fixed file-upload spinner size (lg → sm for inline text context)
- Wired `TeamPanel` into `ProjectDetailPage`: added `teamPanelOpen` state, Team button (admin-only, alongside Invite/Phase), and rendered `<TeamPanel>` in modal section

---

### Phase 2 — Role Functionalities ✅ COMPLETE (on branch `phase-2-role-functionalities`, 2026-04-03)

**Branch:** `phase-2-role-functionalities` — ready to merge into `main`.  
**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-01-phase2-role-functionalities-design.md`  
**Scope:** Frontend-only. No new DB columns, no new API routes.

**What was delivered:**

**Foundation:**
- `frontend/src/constants/roleConfig.js` — `ROLE_CONFIG` + `DEFAULT_CONFIG` feature flag objects per role
- `frontend/src/hooks/useRoleConfig.js` — `useRoleConfig()` returns `{ role, config }` built on existing `useUserRole`

**New components:**
- `McpStatusBadge` — "MCP disconnected" with tooltip "coming in Phase 3"; used in Dashboard header and ProjectDetail sidebar
- `TaskExplainer` — Student "Explain this" + "Break it down" buttons; calls `POST /api/chat` with role-specific prompt, shows response inline in collapsible panel
- `TeamOverviewWidget` — Founder/PM dashboard widget; shows each project with collaborator `AvatarGroup` and count
- `LearningPathBar` — Student dashboard bar; cross-project task completion progress with spring animation

**Dashboard (`Dashboard.jsx`):**
- Fixed stat key mismatch bug (was always showing 0 for completed/tasks/members — keys were wrong)
- Founder/PM: milestone-oriented stat card labels, `TeamOverviewWidget`, always-visible Invite button
- Developer: tech stack filter chips above project grid, estimated hours badge on project cards
- Student: `LearningPathBar`, encouragement banner that adapts copy to completion percentage
- All roles: `McpStatusBadge` in header subtitle

**ProjectDetail (`ProjectDetailPage.jsx`):**
- Replaced hardcoded MCP placeholder text with `McpStatusBadge` component in sidebar
- Developer: clickable resource link badges (external links) + estimated hours per task inline
- Student: `TaskExplainer` rendered on every task item
- Founder/PM: Invite button always visible in header regardless of `userRole`
- `config` prop passed to `PhaseSection` for all task-level role features

**Settings (`SettingsPage.jsx`):**
- Developer (`settingsDefaultApiKey`): API key section scrolls into view on mount
- Student (`hideApiKeyNudge`): entire API key section hidden

**Next session — first action:**
1. Merge `phase-2-role-functionalities` into `main` (same stash/merge flow as Phase 1)
2. Start Phase 3 — MCP Server

---

### Phase 2 — Role Functionalities (detail, for reference)

**All three roles (Developer, Founder/PM, Student) get MCP connection as a base feature.**
Each role then adds on top:

**Developer (on top of base):**
- Tech stack quick-filter on dashboard ✅
- Estimated hours shown prominently on tasks ✅
- Code/resource links rendered as clickable badges ✅
- Settings defaults to API key tab ✅

**Founder / PM (on top of base):**
- Task assignment — assign any task to a specific team member ⏳ (deferred — no collaborator picker UI yet)
- Team overview widget on dashboard ✅
- Dashboard stats oriented toward milestones completed ✅
- Invite button always prominent ✅

**Student (on top of base):**
- "Explain this" button on every task ✅
- "Break this down" — splits a task into smaller sub-steps ✅
- Learning Path progress bar across all projects on dashboard
- Encouragement micro-copy at milestone/phase completion
- No API key nudge (free tier is appropriate)

**All roles:**
- MCP status indicator in project header (connected / disconnected)
- Ability to connect Claude Code via MCP

---

### Phase 3 — MCP Server ← NEXT (NOT STARTED)

**Status:** Defined at high level only. Phase 2 is now shipped — Phase 3 design can begin.

**Goal:** Build an MCP server that exposes the user's Project Planner data as tools Claude Code can call. This turns every project into a living memory — Claude Code reads project status, picks up tasks, marks them complete, and continues work across sessions.

**Planned MCP tools (high level):**
- `get_project_status` — returns current phase, milestone, task completion
- `get_next_tasks` — returns pending/in-progress tasks ordered by priority
- `update_task_status` — marks a task as in-progress or completed
- `add_note_to_task` — attaches a progress note to a task
- `get_project_roadmap` — full roadmap dump for context

**Auth:** MCP server authenticates via user's Supabase JWT or a generated personal access token.

---

### Unstaged Work on `main`

All collaboration work committed. Phase 2 is on `phase-2-role-functionalities` branch — merge into `main` at session start before beginning Phase 3.

**SQL files are committed but may not yet be applied to Supabase DB:**
- `fix-rls-circular-dependency.sql` — apply if `get_project_collaborators` returns an RLS error
- `fix-roadmap-collaboration-rls.sql` — apply if roadmap collaboration queries fail

## 3. Database Schema

### Tables in Production

#### `roadmap` (main projects table — naming is legacy)
Stores all AI-generated project content as a single JSON blob in `content`.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | UUID PK | |
| user_id | UUID FK → auth.users | owner |
| title | text | project title |
| content | text | full roadmap JSON stringified |
| created_at | timestamptz | |
| updated_at | timestamptz | |

#### `project_collaborators`
Tracks team members and their roles on a project.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | UUID PK | |
| project_id | UUID FK → roadmap(id) ON DELETE CASCADE | |
| user_id | UUID FK → auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE | |
| role | text CHECK IN ('admin', 'editor', 'viewer') | |
| invited_by | UUID FK → auth.users | |
| status | text CHECK IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'declined') | default 'accepted' |
| invited_at | timestamptz | |
| responded_at | timestamptz | |
| UNIQUE | (project_id, user_id) | |

#### `project_invitations`
Tracks email-based invitations (for users not yet registered or not yet logged in).

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | UUID PK | |
| project_id | UUID FK → roadmap(id) ON DELETE CASCADE | |
| email | text | invitee email |
| role | text CHECK IN ('editor', 'viewer') | admin cannot be invited, only owner |
| invited_by | UUID FK → auth.users | |
| token | text UNIQUE | random token included in email link |
| expires_at | timestamptz | 7 days from creation |
| status | text CHECK IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'declined', 'expired') | |
| UNIQUE | (project_id, email) | prevents duplicate invitations |

#### `project_activities` (exists in migration, not actively used yet)
Audit trail for all project events.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | UUID PK | |
| project_id | UUID FK | |
| user_id | UUID FK | |
| activity_type | text | |
| description | text | |
| metadata | JSONB | |

#### `user_settings`
Per-user configuration: role, BYOK API key, usage tracking.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | UUID PK | |
| user_id | UUID FK UNIQUE → auth.users | |
| role | text CHECK IN ('developer', 'founder_pm', 'student') | set in Onboarding/Settings |
| api_key_encrypted | text | AES-256-GCM encrypted; NULL = free tier |
| api_provider | text CHECK IN ('gemini', 'claude') | NULL when no key |
| monthly_usage | integer DEFAULT 0 | free-tier generation count |
| usage_limit | integer DEFAULT 10 | free-tier monthly cap |
| usage_reset_at | timestamptz | rolling 30-day reset |
| byok_nudge_dismissed | boolean DEFAULT false | whether user dismissed BYOK prompt |

### DB Functions
- `get_project_collaborators(p_project_id UUID)` — RPC that joins `project_collaborators` with `auth.users` to return full_name + email alongside role.

### RLS Summary
- `roadmap`: owner access + accepted collaborators can view; only owner can delete.
- `project_collaborators`: visible to anyone on the project; admins/owners can insert/delete.
- `project_invitations`: visible to project owner; insert by project owner only.
- `user_settings`: each user can only read/write their own row.

## 4. Architecture Overview

```
Browser (React + React Query)
  ↓ /api/* (Express, port 3001)
Backend (Node/Express)
  ├── /api/chat            → AIProviderService → Gemini or Claude
  ├── /api/upload          → FileProcessingService → text extraction + summarization
  ├── /api/summarize       → TextSummarizer
  ├── /api/prioritize      → RoadmapPrioritizationService
  ├── /api/invite-collaborator → InvitationService → Nodemailer (email)
  ├── /api/accept-invitation   → direct Supabase admin client
  └── /api/user/*          → user.js router → Supabase admin client
        GET    /settings   → read user_settings row
        POST   /role       → update role
        POST   /api-key    → validate key, encrypt, store
        DELETE /api-key    → remove key
        POST   /dismiss-byok-nudge → set byok_nudge_dismissed=true
  ↓
Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS + Auth)
```

**AI routing logic (AIProviderService):**
1. Load `user_settings` for current user (create row if first-time)
2. Reset monthly_usage if `usage_reset_at` is past
3. If `api_key_encrypted` is set → decrypt → route to user's provider (Gemini or Claude)
4. Else (free tier) → check `monthly_usage < usage_limit` → use app's Gemini key → increment counter
5. If limit exceeded → throw `UsageLimitError` (HTTP 429, code `USAGE_LIMIT_REACHED`)

**Key encryption:** AES-256-GCM. Stored as `iv:authTag:ciphertext` (hex-encoded, colon-separated). Key pulled from `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var (64 hex chars = 32 bytes).

## 5. Feature Areas & Status

### 5.1 Core — AI Roadmap Generation

**Status: COMPLETE**

**Flow:**
1. User opens `/new-project-chat`
2. Enters project description (text) or uploads a file (PDF, DOCX, TXT, DOC — max 5MB)
3. File → `/api/upload` → FileProcessingService extracts text → returns `extractedText`
4. Long/unstructured text → `/api/summarize` → TextSummarizer condenses it
5. Description sent to `/api/chat` (with `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`) → AIProviderService → Gemini/Claude
6. AI returns structured JSON roadmap
7. Roadmap parsed, displayed in `NewProjectChatPage`
8. User clicks Save → stored in `roadmap` table as stringified JSON

**Roadmap data shape (inside `content` JSON):**
```json
{
  "projectName": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "timeline": "3 months",
  "experienceLevel": "Intermediate",
  "technologies": ["React", "Node.js"],
  "scope": "MVP",
  "phases": [
    {
      "id": "phase-1",
      "title": "Setup & Architecture",
      "timeline": "Week 1-2",
      "order": 1,
      "milestones": [
        {
          "id": "milestone-1",
          "title": "Project scaffolding",
          "timeline": "Day 1-3",
          "order": 1,
          "tasks": [
            {
              "id": "task-1",
              "title": "Initialize repo",
              "description": "...",
              "technology": "Git",
              "resources": ["https://..."],
              "status": "pending",
              "order": 1
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Prioritization:** After generation, `/api/prioritize` re-orders phases/tasks using a weighted scoring algorithm (dependency analysis, timeline fit, experience level, scope, risk assessment). Config-driven weights in `backend/services/prioritizationConfig.js`.

---

### 5.2 Foundation — User Settings, BYOK, Onboarding

**Status: COMPLETE (all committed)**

**Sub-features:**

**Onboarding (OnboardingModal):**
- Fires once when user saves their **first** project
- Shows role picker: Developer / Founder-PM / Student
- Saves role to `user_settings` via `POST /api/user/role`
- Role controls which features are surfaced prominently in ProjectDetailPage

**BYOK Modal (BYOKModal):**
- Trigger 1: First successful AI generation (appears in NewProjectChatPage)
- Trigger 2: User has 1 free generation remaining
- Prompts user to add their own Gemini or Claude API key
- On dismiss: calls `POST /api/user/dismiss-byok-nudge`

**API Key Management (ApiKeyPanel in Settings):**
- User pastes API key
- Auto-detects provider: `sk-ant-` → Claude, `AIza` → Gemini
- Frontend sends key to `POST /api/user/api-key`
- Backend validates key with minimal test call (1 token), then encrypts + stores
- UI shows masked key (`sk-ant-a...••••••••`)
- Delete key button → `DELETE /api/user/api-key`

**Usage Tracking:**
- Dashboard shows banner: "X of 10 free generations used this month. Add your key →"
- Banner only shown when user has no BYOK key and `monthly_usage > 0`
- Resets every 30 days (rolling window)

**Settings Page (`/settings`):**
- Two tabs: Profile (role selection) and API Key
- Deep-linkable via `?tab=api-key`

---

### 5.3 Collaboration — Invitations, Roles, Team Management

**Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE — collaboration backend + some frontend done; wiring incomplete**

#### What is fully implemented (committed):

**Backend:**
- `POST /api/invite-collaborator` — validates fields, calls InvitationService
- `POST /api/accept-invitation` — validates JWT, checks invitation token, inserts into `project_collaborators`, marks invitation accepted
- `InvitationService.sendInvitation()` — creates token, stores invitation in DB, sends email via Nodemailer
- Email template redesigned (clean, minimal, table-based HTML)

**Frontend:**
- `InviteCollaboratorsModal` — form with email, role (editor/viewer), optional message; validates email, sends to backend
- `checkUserPermission()` in `projectService.js` — checks collaborator table first, then falls back to owner check via `roadmap` table
- Permission checks on `getProject`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject`
- Role-based UI: Invite button shows for `admin` role or `founder_pm` user role
- `MESSAGES.COLLABORATION` constants: roles, permissions, role descriptions
- `AcceptInvitationPage` — route `/accept-invitation?token=…&project=…`, handles auth redirect flow
- `Auth/Callback.jsx` — after OAuth login, checks `localStorage.pendingInvitation` and redirects there

#### What is implemented but NOT yet committed (unstaged):

1. **`frontend/src/pages/AcceptInvitation/AcceptInvitationPage.jsx`** (new file)
   - Reads `token` and `project` from URL query params
   - If not logged in → saves URL to `localStorage.pendingInvitation` → redirects to `/auth`
   - After login, `Callback.jsx` picks up the saved URL and redirects back
   - Calls `POST /api/accept-invitation` with Bearer token
   - Shows success (auto-redirect to project) or error state

2. **`frontend/src/components/Collaboration/TeamPanel.jsx`** (new file)
   - Modal listing all collaborators on a project
   - Calls `getProjectCollaborators()` → `supabase.rpc('get_project_collaborators', …)`
   - Admins see a trash icon to remove members (calls `removeCollaborator()`)
   - Role color badges: admin=purple, editor=blue, viewer=gray

3. **`frontend/src/services/projectService.js`** additions:
   - `getSharedProjects()` — queries `project_collaborators` for accepted entries, fetches those roadmaps, returns with `isShared: true`
   - `getProjectCollaborators(projectId)` — RPC call
   - `removeCollaborator(projectId, userId)` — deletes from `project_collaborators`

4. **`frontend/src/hooks/useDashboardData.js`** — updated to call both `getUserProjects()` and `getSharedProjects()` in parallel, merges results

5. **`frontend/src/components/ProjectCard/ProjectCard.jsx`** — accepts `isShared` prop, shows "Shared" badge with Users icon

6. **`backend/services/invitationService.js`** — cleaner email HTML template

7. **`backend/routes/user.js`** — better error message forwarding for API key validation failures

#### What is STILL MISSING (not built yet):

- **TeamPanel not wired into ProjectDetailPage** — `TeamPanel.jsx` exists but `ProjectDetailPage` does not import or render it; there's no "Team" button to open it
- **Dashboard does not pass `isShared` to ProjectCard** — the `project.isShared` flag is returned by `getSharedProjects` but the Dashboard mapping needs to pass it as a prop
- **No UI to distinguish owned vs. shared projects** in the "Your Roadmaps" list heading (could split into sections or just rely on badge)
- **`MESSAGES.ERROR.COLLABORATORS_LOAD_FAILED`** — referenced in TeamPanel, needs to be verified in constants
- **Shared project edit restrictions in UI** — viewer-role users currently get backend errors when trying to edit; frontend should hide/disable edit controls based on role

---

### 5.4 Project Management — Edit, Delete, Reorder

**Status: COMPLETE (stretch goals)**

- **Editable Tasks:** Edit task title + description via modal in PhaseModal. Validated (no empty titles). Debounced persist (800ms) to Supabase.
- **Milestone Edit/Delete/Reorder:** Drag-and-drop reorder in PhaseModal. Edit modal for details. Delete with confirmation. Frontend validates order before sending. Backend validates edge cases.
- **Phase Create/Edit/Delete:** PhaseModal (create), EditPhaseModal (edit), delete with confirmation. Order preserved.
- **Phase Reorder:** `PHASE_REORDERED` success message. Validated on both frontend and backend.

---

### 5.5 Progress Tracking

**Status: COMPLETE (stretch goal)**

- Task status dropdown: `pending` → `in-progress` → `completed` (+ `blocked`)
- Progress calculated at task, milestone, phase, and overall project level
- `calculateOverallProgress()` in `utils/roadmapUtils.js`
- Progress bars and completion ratios displayed in PhaseCardNew and ProgressBar components
- Task status updates debounced (800ms) before persisting to Supabase
- On persist, React Query cache invalidated for both project detail and user projects

---

### 5.6 Caching

**Status: COMPLETE (stretch goal)**

- TanStack Query v5 (note: `gcTime`, NOT `cacheTime` — v5 renamed it)
- Cache keys: `QUERY_KEYS.USER_PROJECTS`, `QUERY_KEYS.PROJECT_DETAILS`
- `CACHE_CONFIG` in `constants/cache.js` — separate `staleTime`, `gcTime`, `retry` per resource
- On project edit → `queryClient.invalidateQueries([QUERY_KEYS.PROJECT_DETAILS, projectId])` + `queryClient.invalidateQueries([QUERY_KEYS.USER_PROJECTS])`
- Dashboard data cached; only re-fetched when stale or after mutation

---

### 5.7 Settings Page

**Status: COMPLETE**

- Route: `/settings` (protected)
- Nav link in `RootLayout`
- Two tabs: **Profile** (role picker) and **API Key** (ApiKeyPanel)
- Deep-linkable: `?tab=api-key` navigates directly to key tab
- `useUserSettings` hook (React Query) fetches from `GET /api/user/settings`
- `useInvalidateUserSettings` hook to refresh after mutations

---

| New Project Chat — 2-panel + drag-drop upload | `frontend/src/pages/NewProjectChat/NewProjectChatPage.jsx` |
| Project Detail — 3-panel + sidebar + bottom bar | `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetail/ProjectDetailPage.jsx` |
| Settings — consolidated single-scroll page | `frontend/src/pages/Settings/SettingsPage.jsx` |
| Accept Invitation — animated SVG states | `frontend/src/pages/AcceptInvitation/AcceptInvitationPage.jsx` |
| Profile — redirect to /settings | `frontend/src/pages/Profile/Profile.jsx` |

### PENDING — Next session priorities

**Step 0 — Commit unstaged work first (see "Unstaged Work" section above)**

**Step 1 — UI polish pass (do this before Phase 2)**
Run the app in browser and walk every page. Identify any visual issues introduced by the redesign. Common things to check:
- Mobile responsiveness on each page
- Dark ↔ light mode toggle on all pages
- ProgressRing rendering in Dashboard cards
- Project Detail sidebar phase nav scrolling
- New Project Chat output panel rendering `ChatContainer` correctly
- Settings role card selection persisting
- Consider lazy-loading heavy pages (`ProjectDetail`, `NewProjectChat`) with `React.lazy` + `Suspense` to reduce 788kB bundle

**Step 2 — Wire TeamPanel into Project Detail**
`TeamPanel.jsx` exists (`frontend/src/components/Collaboration/TeamPanel.jsx`) but was skipped in Phase 1 because its import path wasn't confirmed. The Project Detail page already has a "Team" button that sets `teamPanelOpen` state — just import and render `<TeamPanel>` at the bottom of the return.

**Step 3 — Pass `isShared` from Dashboard data to project cards**
`useDashboardData.js` already returns `isShared` on each project. The Dashboard `ProjectCardItem` already renders a "Shared" badge when `project.isShared` is truthy. Just verify this is flowing through correctly.

**Step 4 — Verify `get_project_collaborators` DB function**
Run in Supabase SQL editor: `SELECT * FROM get_project_collaborators('<any-project-id>');` — if it errors, apply the SQL from `fix-rls-circular-dependency.sql` and `fix-roadmap-collaboration-rls.sql`.

**Step 5 — Phase 2 (Role Functionalities)**
Do not start until Steps 0–4 are done.

## 7. Unstaged Work (In-Progress Before Phase 1)

> These files are modified/untracked on `main` but not yet committed. Commit them at the start of the next session before doing anything else.

### Modified files
- `backend/package.json` + `backend/package-lock.json` — dependency updates
- `backend/routes/user.js` — better API key error message forwarding
- `backend/services/aiProviderService.js` — minor tweaks
- `backend/services/fileProcessingService.js` — minor tweaks
- `backend/services/invitationService.js` — email template redesign
- `backend/utils/scoringUtils.js` — minor fix
- `frontend/src/components/ProjectCard/ProjectCard.jsx` — isShared "Shared" badge
- `frontend/src/hooks/useDashboardData.js` — fetches shared + owned projects, returns `isShared` flag
- `frontend/src/pages/Auth/Callback.jsx` — pending invitation redirect on login
- `frontend/src/services/projectService.js` — `getSharedProjects`, `getProjectCollaborators`, `removeCollaborator`

### New untracked files
- `frontend/src/components/Collaboration/TeamPanel.jsx` — team member management panel (needs to be wired into ProjectDetailPage)
- `fix-rls-circular-dependency.sql` — SQL fix for RLS policy
- `fix-roadmap-collaboration-rls.sql` — SQL fix for collaboration RLS

## 8. Known Issues & Constraints

1. **React Query v5 naming:** `gcTime` not `cacheTime`. Any new query config must use `gcTime`.
2. **`get_project_collaborators` DB function** — used in `getProjectCollaborators()` via `supabase.rpc()`. Must exist in Supabase. If it doesn't, TeamPanel will fail silently.
3. **Gemini model name** — currently `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` (free tier) and `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` (user key). Was previously `gemini-1.5-flash` — already fixed in a commit.
4. **Claude model for BYOK** — `claude-sonnet-4-5` for generation, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for key validation.
5. **Project title deduplication** — `project_invitations` has `UNIQUE(project_id, email)`. Re-inviting the same email will fail. InvitationService should handle or update the existing invitation.
6. **Owner has no `project_collaborators` row** — permission check first looks in `project_collaborators`, then falls back to ownership check in `roadmap.user_id`. This is by design.
7. **Admin role can only be set directly in DB** — only 'editor' and 'viewer' can be invited via the modal. The project owner is implicitly admin.
8. **`frontend/.npmrc` was deleted** — tracked as a modification in unstaged changes.
9. **Branch is 29 commits ahead of origin/main** — not pushed yet.

## 11. Permission Model

### Roles
| Role | Set By | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | Implicit (project owner) | Full control — edit, delete project, invite others |
| `editor` | Invitation | Can edit tasks, milestones, phases; cannot delete project or invite |
| `viewer` | Invitation | Read-only; can only view and track own progress |

### Permission Matrix
| Action | admin/owner | editor | viewer |
|---|---|---|---|
| View project | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit tasks/milestones/phases | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete project | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Invite collaborators | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Remove collaborators | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Update task status | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own tracking) |

### Frontend role check flow (`checkUserPermission`)
1. Call `supabase.from('project_collaborators').select('role, status').eq('project_id', …).eq('user_id', …).eq('status', 'accepted')`
2. If row found → map role to permissions via `getPermissionForRole(role, permission)`
3. If no row → check `roadmap.user_id === currentUser.id` → owner → all permissions

### User Role (separate concept — onboarding role)
The `role` field in `user_settings` (`developer`, `founder_pm`, `student`) is a **UX role** not a permission role. It controls which features are surfaced prominently:
- `founder_pm` → Invite button shown prominently in ProjectDetailPage
- `developer` → MCP Setup Card placeholder visible (future feature)
- `student` → Standard view

---

## 12. Constants & Messages Reference

### `MESSAGES.COLLABORATION`
```js
ROLES: { ADMIN: 'admin', EDITOR: 'editor', VIEWER: 'viewer' }
PERMISSIONS: { VIEW: 'view', EDIT: 'edit', DELETE: 'delete', INVITE: 'invite' }
ROLE_DESCRIPTIONS: { admin: '…', editor: '…', viewer: '…' }
```

### Key error messages
- `COLLABORATORS_LOAD_FAILED` — used in TeamPanel
- `INVITATION_FAILED` — used in InviteCollaboratorsModal
- `INVITATION_ACCEPT_FAILED` — used in AcceptInvitationPage
- `PERMISSION_DENIED` — used in removeCollaborator handler
- `USAGE_LIMIT_REACHED` — shown when free tier exhausted
- `API_KEY_INVALID` — shown when BYOK key fails validation

### `QUERY_KEYS`
```js
USER_PROJECTS: 'userProjects'
PROJECT_DETAILS: 'projectDetails'
```

### `CACHE_CONFIG`
Separate staleTime, gcTime, retry per resource. Configured in `constants/cache.js`.

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

### Immediate — Before Phase 1 UI Work Starts
1. **Commit all unstaged collaboration work** — group into a single commit: "feat: collaboration dashboard, shared projects, team panel, accept invitation page"
2. **Wire TeamPanel into ProjectDetailPage** — add "Team" button in the header, import TeamPanel, pass `isAdmin={userRole === 'admin'}` and `currentUserId={user?.id}`
3. **Pass `isShared` from Dashboard to ProjectCard** — in Dashboard's project list render, check `project.isShared` and pass as prop
4. **Verify `get_project_collaborators` DB function** — run in Supabase SQL Editor to confirm it exists
5. **Role-aware edit UI** — after loading project, use `userRole` state to hide/disable edit controls for viewers
6. **Test full invitation flow end-to-end** — invite email → click link → auth → accept → redirect to project → collaborator appears in TeamPanel
7. **Push to origin/main** — currently 29 commits ahead and not pushed

### Phase 1 — UI Redesign (CURRENTLY BEING PLANNED)
- Finish design spec → write implementation plan → execute page by page
- See `CURRENT SESSION STATUS` section at top of this file for full Phase 1 scope
- New library to add: **Framer Motion** (spring physics, page transitions)
- Design spec will be saved to: `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-ui-redesign-design.md`
- Implementation plan will be saved to: `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ui-redesign.md`

### Phase 2 — Role Functionalities (NOT STARTED — after Phase 1 ships)
- See `CURRENT SESSION STATUS` section for full role breakdown
- Requires backend changes for task assignment (new `task_assignments` column or table)

### Phase 3 — MCP Server (NOT STARTED — after Phase 2 ships)
- See `CURRENT SESSION STATUS` section for planned MCP tools
- Entirely new system; do not start until Phase 2 is complete
